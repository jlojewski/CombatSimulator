C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
Off with their head!
Now, back to 9/11.
This ain't rock and roll, this is genocide!
Ain't text-based slaughter graphic?
Now, onto the next.
Can't stop, won't stop!
Do they bleed pixels?
But is it enough to secure a victory?
Don't get cocky, kid!
Go for broke!
Is it ever gonna be enough?
This is good for Bitcoin.
Is celebration in order?
Two men enter, one man leaves.
Rest in peace.
Goodnight, sweet prince.
Y'all need Jesus.
Rest in pepperoni.
There probably was a way to avoid this.
They faced their end with dignity.
Drive your cart and plow over the bones of the dead.
Too bad.
Someone drew the short straw.
Death is the road to awe, indeed.
Nobody was chanting their name, anyway.
That's why you don't root for the underdogs.
Guess they never learned about the better part of valor.
No tears, just dreams now.
There's blood in my stool!
Somebody call the whambulance!
And they were only two days away from retirement!
Better luck next time.
I never liked them anyway.
Clean kill.
The crowd goes mild!
Something wicked this way came.
Veni, vidi, veni.
I'd say something pretentious, but I don't know latin.
They made one fatal slip.
Doctorate denied.
They'll be back. Not.
If killing them was wrong, I don't wanna be right!
Look at that ugly mug!
Death rattle sadly not implemented.
And nobody cares!
And nothing of value was lost.
Happy happy joy!
Their truth keeps marching on.
Sleep now in the fire.
As fearless in death as he was in life.
As fearless in death as he was in life. Which is to say, not really.
Yoink!
And that is that.
Please trip them gently - they don't like to fall.
Godspeed.
Bagged and tagged.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
What a disappointment.
They have tried and failed. The lesson is: never try.
Can someone please scrape them off the floor?
Not bad.
I didn't know they had permission to murder and to maim.
Stay tuned for more violence.
There goes my betting money.
Rekt.
No amount of mommy kisses can help them now.
This is why we can't have nice things.
Should have dodged.
Thoughts and prayers.
Ain't that a kick in the head.
Dibs on the jacket.
Did anyone see that coming?
Brought to you by Phisher Price!
Does their insurance cover this?
Kids love this!
May end up being a tough act to follow.
They died as they lived, a Java object until the very end.
This changes things.
Groovy.
Fatality!
Woe be to the others.
It's probably for the best.
Mace, meet face!
Oh the humanity!
This was their final battlefield.
It's murder on the dancefloor!
What's a little murder between friends?
Stab them again, just to be sure.
The worms cheer!
How the tables have turned.
Clearly a skill issue.
Skill issue.
Hit them right between the eyes.
Good news, everyone!
Not fast enough.
It's a good day in the neighborhood.
That's how you put 'fun' in 'funeral'!
They're out of the contest.
Found wanting and all that.
Should have competed in Wheel of Fortune instead.
A moment of silence for the fallen.
Or perhaps I should say 'slain'.
It's like poetry, it rhymes.
Bad time to eat a sandwich.
It's as they say: you can check out anytime you want, but you can never leave.
For once in their life they did something exciting.
Finally!
